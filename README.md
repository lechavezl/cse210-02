Are you ready to find out how lucky you are? You can win or lose everything in this game in a matter of seconds. The rules are simple, you start with 300 points, and 13 cards are displayed on the board. Your goal is to guess if the next card is higher or lower than the current one. If you guess correctly, you win 100 points, but if not, you lose 75 points. You can keep playing as many times as you want as long as you have points, but if you reach 0, the game ends. What do you say? Are you ready to show your luck?
